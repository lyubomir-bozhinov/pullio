# pullio

A dead-simple cross-platform Go application that updates all Git repositories in a directory tree. It automatically locates Git repositories, detects their default branches, and performs a fast-forward pull to update them.

## Disclaimer

Yes, you can achieve this with one of the numerous variations of the line below:
```bash
find . -type d -name .git -exec sh -c "cd \"{}\"/../ && pwd && git pull" \;
```

Aliasing that with your SSH agent setup would yield an over-powered one-liner. So, why bother building pullio? Because we can.

## Features

- Finds all Git repositories in a directory tree
- Automatically sets up SSH agent and adds your SSH key if needed
- Detects the default branch of each repository
- Pulls the latest changes to your local
- Processes repositories concurrently for better performance
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Provides clear, color-coded output with success/failure status

## Requirements

- Git must be installed and available in your PATH
- SSH key for repositories that require authentication

## Installation

### Using pre-built binaries

GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o bin/pullio-darwin-arm64 cmd/pullio/main.go
```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage (updates all repositories in current directory)
./pullio

# Specify a different SSH key
./pullio -key ~/.ssh/my_custom_key

# Specify different default branches to try
./pullio -branches "dev,main,master"

# Set the number of concurrent operations
./pullio -concurrent 8

# Enable verbose output
./pullio -verbose

# Start from a specific directory
./pullio -path /path/to/repositories
```
