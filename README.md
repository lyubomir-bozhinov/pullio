# pullio

A cross-platform Go application that updates all Git repositories in a directory tree. It automatically locates Git repositories, detects their default branches, and performs a fast-forward pull to update them.

## Features

- Finds all Git repositories in a directory tree
- Automatically sets up SSH agent and adds your SSH key if needed
- Detects the default branch of each repository
- Performs a fast-forward only pull to avoid merge conflicts
- Processes repositories concurrently for better performance
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Provides clear, color-coded output with success/failure status

## Requirements

- Git must be installed and available in your PATH
- SSH key for repositories that require authentication
